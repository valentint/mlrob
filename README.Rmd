# ```mlrob```: Data preprocessing techniques and tools for classification


## Installation

The ``mlrob`` package is not yet on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) 

##    install.packages("mlrob")

## Building from source

To install the latest stable development version from GitHub, you can pull this repository and install it using

    ## install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("valentint/mlrob")

Of course, if you have already installed `remotes`, you can skip the
first line (I have commented it out).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you if the package is properly installed:

```{r example}

library(mlrob)
dd <- get_data("Iris")
(out <- LdaFisher(dd$x, dd$grp))
plot(out)
